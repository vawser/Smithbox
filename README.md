## Requirements

* [Visual C++ Redistributable x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
* For the error message "You must install or update .NET to run this application", use these exact download links. It is not enough to install the default .NET runtime.
  * [Microsoft .NET Core 7.0 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet/7.0/windowsdesktop-runtime-win-x64.exe)
  * [Microsoft .NET Core 7.0 ASP.NET Core Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet/7.0/aspnetcore-runtime-win-x64.exe)
* A Vulkan 1.3 compatible graphics card with up to date graphics drivers: NVIDIA Maxwell (900 series) and newer or AMD Polaris (Radeon 400 series) and newer
* Intel GPUs currently don't seem to be working properly. At the moment you will need a dedicated NVIDIA or AMD GPU
* A 4GB (8GB recommended) of VRAM if modding DS3/BB/Sekiro/ER maps due to huge map sizes
