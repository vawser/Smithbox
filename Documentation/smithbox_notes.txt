# BUGS
#---------------------
- Map Editor: fix ER NVA so saves are BP correct (currently the Write side is quite off)
- Map Editor: DS3 navmeshes position seems off in some maps (Undead Settlement)

- Model Editor: Make the mesh entries use the sub-meshes properly
- Model Editor: Fix property editing for the sub-classes (FaceSet, Texture, etc)
- Model Editor: dummy duplicate doesn't stick
- Model Editor: bone position cannot be changed (resets itself on gizmo move)
- Model Editor: DS2 chrs loading badly, parts + map pieces failed to find

- Param Editor: adjust the difference checker to account for row index

#---------------------
# FEATURES
#---------------------
- Viewport add ability to change viewport background color

- Map Editor add Object Mass Edit that allows for addition/deletion of map objects programmatically
- Map Editor implement Edge support for SDT

- Map Editor:
  - Get gizmos to work in Orthographic/Oblique view mode
  - Implement the auto-BTAB handling actions
  - Add map piece link in BTAB properties 
  
- Model Editor Add simple JSON export/import for elements of FLVER

- Param Editor Table Group column should have difference highlighting if any of the internal rows are highlighted as different
 
- Text Editor: Implement FMG Descriptor support (to replace enums) 

- Texture Editor add automated mass export
- Texture Editor add individual icon export based on subtexture
- Texture Editor adjust IconConfig to support NR DLC icon setup: add try for DLC variants if initial lookup fails
 (i.e. Item fails to find anything, use Item-DLC01 instead. This means we can list only Item in the meta, but support variants automatically)
 
- Material Editor: add power search to file list 
 (i.e. param: g_BlendMode = 6 should filter the list down to all files that contain a parameter called g_BlendMode set to 6)
 (i.e. texture: Path ~ fire should filter the list down to all files that contain a texture with the Path string that contains the string 'fire')
- Material Editor: add list add/remove actions for the Param/Texture lists in a MTD
- Material Editor: implement changes needed for the MATBIN properties

# DOCUMENTATION

- Param Editor: finish syncing the AC6 meta to the leaked paramdefs (was around NpcParam)

How to add a field boss being able to be red / mutated:
Find its SmallBaseMapVariationParam ID. For example magma wyrm has 4668.
In ChaosMatchingMutationEnemyTableParam the ID that handles its mutation is 46680000.
Then you need to find the new boss variation id in properties (in map editor).
For example with variety 1 you copy the row and increment by 1000 so it becomes 46681000. 
Then change unk_02 to correspond to variety, so in this case 1.

When there are multiple creatures you need to assign them a unique value in the map editor properties Unk3E. (You can reference how ruins are setup in map editor.)
You will then need to make new rows in ChaosMatchingMutationEnemyTableParam and set unk_01a to that unique value.

ChaosMatchingMutationEnemyTableParam unk_00 is for the type of creature. For example in a ruin, The the boss Depraved Perfumer has 366. Operatic Bat (strong mob) has 357, miranda flower (trash mob) has 358. I'm guessing these values are related to ChaosMatchingMutationCategoryParam which I think handles the amount of mutated enemies for different categories that exist in total, but I havent figured that out.
