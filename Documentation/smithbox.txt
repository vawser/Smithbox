# TODO FEATURES
- Viewport FEAT: add ability to change viewport background color
- Viewport FEAT: implement orthographic view
- Viewport FEAT: add track selection camera toggle - camera locks onto selection and moves in-line with any movement to the selection

- Map Editor FEAT: add Object Mass Edit that allows for addition/deletion of map objects programmatically
- Map Editor FEAT: implement Edge support for SDT
- Map Editor FEAT: look into a AABB bounding box gizmo mode where the centre is placed based on the model (for baked offset models where the position is normally 0,0,0)
- Map Editor FEAT: add BTAB auto-tools

- Model Editor FEAT: Add simple JSON export/import for elements of FLVER

- Param Editor FEAT: Table Group column should have difference highlighting if any of the internal rows are highlighted as different
- Param Editor FEAT: add a special-case mass edit search command "item:" which searches all of the itemlot item fields for a match
 - Makes it a lot more feasible to filter to ALL instances of X item within the itemlots without a 8 term search filter
 - Only works with the itemlot params (obviously)
- Param Editor FEAT: add param port tool: select base row in existing project + target project -> bring up selection window that displays the target project's params (of the currently selected param), 
 - allow user to select which to port over. Use the selected base row as the base for the ported rows, and then copy values over based on field name matching (perhaps add some heuristics too for minor deviations)

- Texture Editor FEAT: add automated mass export
- Texture Editor FEAT: add individual icon export based on subtexture
- Texture Editor FEAT: adjust IconConfig to support NR DLC icon setup: add try for DLC variants if initial lookup fails
 (i.e. Item fails to find anything, use Item-DLC01 instead. This means we can list only Item in the meta, but support variants automatically)
 
# TODO DOCS
- Param Editor DOC: finish syncing the AC6 meta to the leaked paramdefs (was around NpcParam)

# TODO BUGS
- Map Editor BUG: fix ER NVA so saves are BP correct (currently the Write side is quite off)
- Map Editor BUG: DS3 navmeshes position seems off in some maps (Undead Settlement)

- Model Editor BUG: Make the mesh entries use the sub-meshes properly
- Model Editor BUG: Fix property editing for the sub-classes (FaceSet, Texture, etc)

- Param Editor BUG: Param Merge doesn't seem to merge in modified VALUES
- Param Editor BUG: adjust the difference checker to account for row index
