# TODO LIST
- Map / Model Editor: implement VFS for model / texture loading (requires resource manager workflow rework)
- Viewport: add ability to change viewport background color

- Map Editor: implement orthographic view
- Map Editor: add JSON export for MSB
- Map Editor: add special map connections for NR
- Map Editor: add Object Mass Edit that allows for addition/deletion of map objects programmatically
- Map Editor: Selection Outline: mesh creation currently creates an issue when selecting too many entities. Ideally we can switch to an opacity or tint on the actual model: however this requires a overhaul of the rendering pipeline, currently the rendering side is instanced and detacted from the map editor state, making it difficult to apply conditional visuals.
- Map Editor: Add Vector3 support to MSB Mass Edit

- Model Editor: implement VFS + data bank overhaul
- Model Editor: use the direct method for the MeshResources/Texture resources, break the link to the ResourceManager
- Model Editor: add simple JSON export/import for elements of FLVER
- Model Editor: order dummy polygon list by parent bone (as option?)

- Param Editor: add cross-project commutative param duplicate (ER -> NR, NR -> ER)
- Param Editor: Param Merge doesn't seem to merge in modified VALUES
- Param Editor: adjust the difference checker to account for row index
- Param Editor: Table Group column should have difference highlighting if any of the internal rows are highlighted as different

- Gparam Editor: properly find out the new NR field type structures, so they can be edited.

- Text Editor: FMG Export should include the associated-types (e.g. export for Title should include Desc and Summary) when in the default display mode

- Texture Editor: add automated mass export
- Texture Editor: add individual icon export based on subtexture

# TODO NOW

- Update NR MSB format
 - Event.Teamfight -> Likely MSB version issue where the currenty mismatches are an older version (as I've updated the Teamfight def for the latest version)
 
- Fix the text entry quick-link (from Text Search)
- Fix the focus text entry action when quick-linked (currently it doesn't scroll to position)
