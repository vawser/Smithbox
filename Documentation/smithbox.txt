# TODO LIST
- Viewport: add ability to change viewport background color

- Map Editor: implement orthographic view
- Map Editor: add JSON export for MSB
- Map Editor: add Object Mass Edit that allows for addition/deletion of map objects programmatically
- Map Editor: Selection Outline: mesh creation currently creates an issue when selecting too many entities. Ideally we can switch to an opacity or tint on the actual model: however this requires a overhaul of the rendering pipeline, currently the rendering side is instanced and detacted from the map editor state, making it difficult to apply conditional visuals.
- Map Editor: Add Vector3 support to MSB Mass Edit
- Map Editor: implement Edge support for SDT
- Map Editor: add toggle for the increment tool shortcut behavior (per-frame, per press) + cooldown between frame applications
- Map Editor: Fix up ER NVA (reads ok, but isn't accurate)
- Map Editor: improve texturing rendering (some textures still missing)

- Model Editor: add simple JSON export/import for elements of FLVER
- Model Editor: order dummy polygon list by parent bone (as option?)

- Param Editor: add cross-project commutative param duplicate (ER -> NR, NR -> ER)
- Param Editor: Param Merge doesn't seem to merge in modified VALUES
- Param Editor: adjust the difference checker to account for row index
- Param Editor: Table Group column should have difference highlighting if any of the internal rows are highlighted as different
- Param Editor: add a special-case mass edit search command "item:" which searches all of the itemlot item fields for a match
 - Makes it a lot more feasible to filter to ALL instances of X item within the itemlots without a 8 term search filter
 - Only works with the itemlot params (obviously)

- Gparam Editor: update GPARAM implementation with TKGP's new version, should allow NR gparam editing

- Text Editor: FMG Export should include the associated-types (e.g. export for Title should include Desc and Summary) when in the default display mode

- Texture Editor: add automated mass export
- Texture Editor: add individual icon export based on subtexture

- File Browser: add category that represents the project's file dictionary in filesystem form, to allow for natural browsing and then direct extraction from the VFS. Mainly so the game doesn't ever need to be unpacked personally

# TODO NOW
- Model Editor: rewrite to follow map editor principles: focus on model view + dummy editing + basic FLVER property edits
