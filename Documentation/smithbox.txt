 - FIX: dummy position needs to be offset by parent bone (currently this is ignored)
 - FIX: account for scale when displaying dummies/bones
 - FIX: FLVER save validation: report of radahn appearing broken on re-save, black hair occurs.

Material Editor
 - ADD: Implement Material/MATBIN editor

Param Editor:
 - ADD: stayparam support for DS3 (requires 'blob' editor with manual definitions)
 - ADD: Able to sort row order manually
 - ADD: make "Use project meta" merge in new entries instead of wholesale replacing (https://github.com/ividyon/WitchyBND/blob/main/WitchyBND/Configuration.cs)

Text Editor:
 - REWORK: remove the in-built categorization of the FMGs, add as an optional bundling, but internally they should reflect the actual FMG binder structure
 
 - ADD: FMG Generator script creation modal
 - ADD: FMG Generator open script folder (for project)
 - ADD: add modified filter
 
 - FIX: internal vanilla entry should be preferred over internal dlc01/dlc02 entry due to FMG read preference (vanilla entry overrides dlc1 entry, dlc1 entry overrides dlc2 entry)
 
Gparam Editor:
 - ADD: json export/import of GPARAM (plus sub-classes?)
 - ADD: gparam reference support (e.g. jump to map param, and if it is offset, that value entry offset)
 - ADD: sticky selection: don't automatically clear selection, rather only clear it if it becomes invalid

Time Act Editor
 - ADD: TAE Mass Edit tool

 - ADD: quicklink to TimeAct from param
 
 - FIX: TAE a330 + a331 in AC6 are not reading correctly

 - FIX: Template bank doesn't properly update on project switch

Texture Viewer: 
 - ADD: support for tpfbdt files 
 - ADD: support for 'custom' Shoebox Layouts for non-Shoebox Layout games. Smithbox will instead read from a Shoebox folder in .smithbox for these games.
 - ADD: ability to edit Shoebox Layouts (subwindow)
 - ADD: ability to inject new DDS file into existing binder (would need to move ROOT instances to MOD first)
 - ADD: ability to export selected icon 'section' of icon file (assuming texture has a shoebox layout)
 
 - FIX: Support AC6 Parts (need to change how ResourceManager holds the virtual paths since the AC6 uses the same filename but with different extensions)
 - FIX: Image Preview fails for users when they edit an icon image file and save it incorrectly (as BC3 and not BC7)
 
Documentation:
 - ADD: finish documenting ER SOTE rows
