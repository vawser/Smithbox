# TODO LIST
- Viewport: add ability to change viewport background color

- Map Editor: implement orthographic view
- Map Editor: add JSON export for MSB
- Map Editor: add Object Mass Edit that allows for addition/deletion of map objects programmatically
- Map Editor: Selection Outline: mesh creation currently creates an issue when selecting too many entities. Ideally we can switch to an opacity or tint on the actual model: however this requires a overhaul of the rendering pipeline, currently the rendering side is instanced and detacted from the map editor state, making it difficult to apply conditional visuals.
- Map Editor: Add Vector3 support to MSB Mass Edit
- Map Editor: implement Edge support for SDT
- Map Editor: Fix up ER NVA (reads ok, but isn't accurate)

- Model Editor: add simple JSON export/import for elements of FLVER
- Model Editor: order dummy polygon list by parent bone (as option?)

- Param Editor: add cross-project commutative param duplicate (ER -> NR, NR -> ER)
- Param Editor: Param Merge doesn't seem to merge in modified VALUES
- Param Editor: adjust the difference checker to account for row index
- Param Editor: Table Group column should have difference highlighting if any of the internal rows are highlighted as different
- Param Editor: add a special-case mass edit search command "item:" which searches all of the itemlot item fields for a match
 - Makes it a lot more feasible to filter to ALL instances of X item within the itemlots without a 8 term search filter
 - Only works with the itemlot params (obviously)

- Gparam Editor: properly find out the new NR field type structures, so they can be edited.

- Text Editor: FMG Export should include the associated-types (e.g. export for Title should include Desc and Summary) when in the default display mode

- Texture Editor: add automated mass export
- Texture Editor: add individual icon export based on subtexture

# TODO NOW
- Model Editor: implement VFS + data bank overhaul
- Model Editor: use the direct method for the MeshResources/Texture resources, break the link to the ResourceManager


- TODO: fix issues with the texture loading
