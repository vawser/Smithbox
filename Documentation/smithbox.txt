# TODO LIST
- Map / Model Editor: implement VFS for model / texture loading (requires resource manager workflow rework)
- Viewport: add ability to change viewport background color

- Map Editor: implement orthographic view
- Map Editor: add JSON export for MSB
- Map Editor: add special map connections for NR
- Map Editor: add Object Mass Edit that allows for addition/deletion of map objects programmatically
- Map Editor: Selection Outline: mesh creation currently creates an issue when selecting too many entities. Ideally we can switch to an opacity or tint on the actual model: however this requires a overhaul of the rendering pipeline, currently the rendering side is instanced and detacted from the map editor state, making it difficult to apply conditional visuals.

- Model Editor: implement VFS + data bank overhaul
- Model Editor: use the direct method for the MeshResources/Texture resources, break the link to the ResourceManager
- Model Editor: add simple JSON export/import for elements of FLVER
- Model Editor: order dummy polygon list by parent bone (as option?)

- Param Editor: add cross-project commutative param duplicate (ER -> NR, NR -> ER)
- Param Editor: Param Merge doesn't seem to merge in modified VALUES
- Param Editor: adjust the difference checker to account for row index
- Param Editor: Table Group column should have difference highlighting if any of the internal rows are highlighted as different

- Gparam Editor: properly find out the new NR field type structures, so they can be edited.

- Text Editor: FMG Export should include the associated-types (e.g. export for Title should include Desc and Summary) when in the default display mode

- Texture Editor: add automated mass export
- Texture Editor: add individual icon export based on subtexture

# TODO NOW

- Project:
 - Add CFG option to disable .bak and .prev generation (for Map and Param saves)
 - Add 'full' backup toggle option that produces versioned backups for some editor files (MSB, params, gparams) where the exact time is appended and stored in a separate backup folder. This allows for people not using git to maintain full data integrity at the expense of hard drive space.
 - Restore the auto-save support
 
 - Fix the ME3 mod launch action
 
- Added Vector3 support to MSB Mass Edit
