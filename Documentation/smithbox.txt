# TODO LIST
- Viewport: add ability to change viewport background color

- Map Editor: implement orthographic view
- Map Editor: add Object Mass Edit that allows for addition/deletion of map objects programmatically
- Map Editor: Add Vector3 support to MSB Mass Edit
- Map Editor: implement Edge support for SDT
- Map Editor: add toggle for the increment tool shortcut behavior (per-frame, per press) + cooldown between frame applications
- Map Editor: improve ER NVA so saves are BP correct (currently the Write side is quite off)
- Map Editor: improve texture lookup

- Param Editor: Param Merge doesn't seem to merge in modified VALUES
- Param Editor: adjust the difference checker to account for row index
- Param Editor: Table Group column should have difference highlighting if any of the internal rows are highlighted as different
- Param Editor: add a special-case mass edit search command "item:" which searches all of the itemlot item fields for a match
 - Makes it a lot more feasible to filter to ALL instances of X item within the itemlots without a 8 term search filter
 - Only works with the itemlot params (obviously)
- Param Editor: add param port tool: select base row in existing project + target project -> bring up selection window that displays the target project's params (of the currently selected param), allow user to select which to port over. Use the selected base row as the base for the ported rows, and then copy values over based on field name matching (perhaps add some heuristics too for minor deviations)

- Gparam Editor: update GPARAM implementation with TKGP's new version, should allow NR gparam editing

- Texture Editor: add automated mass export
- Texture Editor: add individual icon export based on subtexture

- File Browser: add category that represents the project's file dictionary in filesystem form, to allow for natural browsing and then direct extraction from the VFS. Mainly so the game doesn't ever need to be unpacked personally

# TODO NOW
- Model Editor: 
 - Sort out the property view (give it a table layout, fix some of the property handling)
 - Add proper transform action for the dummy and node entities
 - Restore some of the tools from the old version
 - add simple JSON export/import for elements of FLVER
 - order dummy polygon list by parent bone (as option?)

 - Parts not appearing (virt path issues likely)
