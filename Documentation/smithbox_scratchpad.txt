# TODO 
#---------------------
- Implement FMG Descriptor pattern for Text Editor
- Implement Views for Text Editor

- BUG: project randomly crashes on finalizing step (likely ImGui bug as no exception), perhaps race condition that fails a ImGui element pairing in Param Editor

# TODO:


- Param Delta Patcher:
 - Add Selected Rows Only option support
 - Added option for import to ignore already modified rows (i.e. second import only applies changes that don't collide with the first import's)
