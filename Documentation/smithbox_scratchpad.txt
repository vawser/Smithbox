- ER: World Map Editor
 - Specific editor for the world map tile textures, should present them similarly to the Map Editor world map feature, but constructs the map from the actual tiles + includes the layering stuff
 - Would then enable an editor for MapTexInfo, which controls weather
 
- Work out why a big map object delete doesn't undo properly (i.e. throws outofrange exceptions)

- Add new loading modal to the Map load process
