Map Editor:
 Map List needs to be adjusted so the 'loaded' highlights are per view
 Save process should also be adjusted to only save the active view's loaded maps
 
 Add viewport instances (within view), so multiple viewports for one view's backing data can be displayed
  - Frame action uses most recently created instance (ActiveViewport)
