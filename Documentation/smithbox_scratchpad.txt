- Implement FMG Descriptor pattern for Text Editor
- Implement Views for Text Editor

- Think about a Delta patch concept for the Param Editor: 
 params = {
    <param> = {
        rows = {
            <row> = {
                fields = {
                    <field> = <value>
                }
            }
        }
    }
 }
 
- User would generate a delta patch (resulting in a JSON object as above): their current parambank checked against vanillabank (or an auxbank)
- User can then apply a delta patch directly to their current parambank.
- Easier to reason about compared to the current mass edit merger.
- Opens the possible for a user to manually pick and choose which elements to merge, or to adjust on the fly (i.e. shift all row IDs in one section by Y amount, and then perhaps update any usage of said ID in other elements.
